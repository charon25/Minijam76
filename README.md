# Spalt
This game was made by me alone between the 19<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> of March 2021 for the [**MiniJam 76**](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-76-radiation) on the theme *Radiation* with the limitation *One Handed Controls*.

It is my first game made in Python (with Pygame only) !

It ranked 27<sup>th</sup> out of 130 overall, and 18<sup>th</sup> in Concept.
